Seattle Times Map Template
===============================

This template for `grunt-init <http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding>`__ sets up an embeddable Leaflet map using a set of custom elements. It's intended to quickly spin up maps using GeoJSON. It's based on the `Seattle Times News App template <https://github.com/seattletimes/newsapp-template>`__, and you should refer to that for more information on the work it does.

Using the template
------------------

Once installed, the following steps will get a map up and running quickly:

1. Run ``grunt-init`` in your project directory to initialize the scaffolding.
2. Replace the ``states.geo.json`` file with your own GeoJSON.
3. Update ``index.html`` to include this new GeoJSON, and use the ``<geo-palette>`` and ``<geo-popup>`` elements to color and annotate it, respectively.
